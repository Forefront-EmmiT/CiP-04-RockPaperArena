## Project Setup
This project consists of two main parts:
1. **Backend**: A Node.js server built with TypeScript and Express.
2. **Frontend**: A React application created with Next.js.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

---

## Starting the Backend

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

---

## Starting the Frontend

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The frontend application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes
- Ensure the backend is running before accessing the frontend, as the frontend may rely on backend APIs.
